# palmerpenguinsinfovis
An information visualization focused project, using d3.js, over the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) dataset. Currently, an additional feature to generate new penguin instances and predict the species of data examples given by the user is being developed, using scikit-learn in a Flask server and AJAX calls for communication.
