# palmerpenguinsinfovis
An information visualization focused web-app, using d3.js, over the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) dataset. Currently, an additional feature to generate new penguin instances and predict the species of data examples given by the user is being developed, using multiple machine learning models through scikit-learn running on a Flask server.
